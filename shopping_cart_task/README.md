# Pet Shopping Cart Project

## Paws_n_Cart

### Overview

Valentina, an animal enthusiast who frequently shops online for pet supplies and volunteers at an animal shelter, needs a pet-related shopping cart application. The goal of this project, named Paws n Cart, is to develop a program that allows users to manage their pet product purchases, view the cart, add/remove items, and calculate the total cost.

### Project Objectives

Develop a program to:

- Create a user-friendly shopping cart.
- Allow users to add and remove items from their cart.
- Calculate the total cost of the cart upon request.

### Step-by-Step Tasks

1. **Data Structure:**

   - Create variables to store items and their prices. This can be implemented using lists or dictionaries.

2. **User Menu:**

   - Develop a clear user menu that displays cart options such as add, remove, view total cost, and checkout.
   - Use a while loop to continuously present the menu to users.

3. **Manipulating the Cart:**

   - Implement functions to add and remove items from the cart using list or string operations.

4. **Calculating Total Cost:**
   - Iterate through the list of prices for each item to calculate the total cost of the cart.

### Advanced Challenges

- Allow users to change the quantity of each item.
- Add functionality to suggest personalized items based on the user's cart.
- Restrict users to choose items only from a predefined list.

### Summary

Create a shopping cart application that:

- Implements a cart mechanism using strings or lists to store different items.
- Enables users to add and remove items from the cart.
- Ensures clear display of the cart to the user.
- Calculates the total cost of the cart when requested.
- Provides an option for users to checkout when ready.

### Tips for Problem Solving

- Utilize a while loop to continuously display the menu and user's cart.
- When storing items in a string, separate each item with a ","
- Store the prices of each item in a String or List in the same order as the cart.
